     <h1>Biography</h1>
    <div class="container">
    <p>Hello my name is <b>Daniel Chavez</b> I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran, I served from 2015 to 2019 in which time I was a Combat Engineer for 1<sup>st</sup> Marine Division  1<sup>st</sup>Combat Engineer Battalion. Proud of my achievement in the Marine Corps I decided I wanted to seperate from the service in order to go to school and find a career I would be happy with and truly making a difference. At first I tried going to college where I learned the basics of coding as well as the history behind the technology, then I took introductary classes that showed me some of the corps fundamentals of coding however in that time the pandemic had kicked off making my classes   <i>San Diego Global Knowledge University</i> coding bootcamp so I can get my foot in the door of this ever expanding industry. From this coding camp I hope to begin my career in tech and to give myself a good baseline for my coding abilities.</p>
    
    <h2>what I do</h2>

    <p> My interest include basketball, cross country moutain biking, skateboarding and many other activities not including the ones I want to throw myself into. I am very much a physical person that enjoys the mental aspect of programing as well as the problem solving involved in debugging,  </p>
